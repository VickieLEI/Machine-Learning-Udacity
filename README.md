# Machine-Learning-Udacity

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying ML models using AWS SageMaker. This repository consists of a number of tutorial notebooks for various case studies, code exercises, and project files that will be to illustrate parts of the ML workflow and give you practice deploying a variety of ML algorithms.

### Tutorials

* [Population Segmentation](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/tree/master/Population_Segmentation): Learn how to build and deploy unsupervised models in SageMaker. In this example, you'll cluster US Census data; reducing the dimensionality of data using PCA and the clustering the resulting, top components with k-means.
* [Payment Fraud Detection](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/tree/master/Payment_Fraud_Detection): Learn how to build and deploy a supervised, LinearLearner model in SageMaker. You'll tune a model and handle a case of class imbalance to train a model to detect cases of credit card fraud.
* [Starbucks_Capstone]: A personal designed project to recommend the best offer for starbucks. You'll tune different models and help the manager to decide which offer should send to our customers to receive the highest completion rate.

### Project

[Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies/tree/master/Project_Plagiarism_Detection): Build an end-to-end plagiarism classification model. Apply your skills to clean data, extract meaningful features, and deploy a plagiarism classifier in SageMaker.
